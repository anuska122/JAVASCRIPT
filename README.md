# JAVASCRIPT

## In This Repository I am going to continue my pervious journey of learning Web Development.

### Here I am going to dive into Web Development in more detailed form than before and will be doing different interesting projects related to the topic I studied.

### JavaScript Object
- Here I am going to Include JavaScript Object Defination and Properties.

**Object Defination**

- Objects are important data structures in JavaScript. This is partly because arrays are objects in JavaScript, and we'll use them all the time. JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

 - Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword).
 - Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword).
 - Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword).
 - Dates are always objects.
 - Maths are always objects.
 - Regular expressions are always objects.
 - Arrays are always objects.
 - Functions are always objects.
 - Objects are always objects.
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.



**Object Properties**

Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.
