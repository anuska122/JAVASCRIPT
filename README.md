# JAVASCRIPT

## In This Repository I am going to continue my pervious journey of learning Web Development.

### Here I am going to dive into Web Development in more detailed form than before and will be doing different interesting projects related to the topic I studied.

## Day1

### JavaScript Object
- Here I am going to Include JavaScript Object Defination and Properties.

**Object Defination**

- Objects are important data structures in JavaScript. This is partly because arrays are objects in JavaScript, and we'll use them all the time. JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

 - Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword).
 - Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword).
 - Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword).
 - Dates are always objects.
 - Maths are always objects.
 - Regular expressions are always objects.
 - Arrays are always objects.
 - Functions are always objects.
 - Objects are always objects.
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.



**Object Properties**

Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties. Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

## Day2

###  JavaScript Object
- Today I have learned about the sub-topics of Js object that is Object method, display, accessors, constructors and prototypes.

**JS Object Method**

- JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

**Object display**

- Some common solutions to display JavaScript objects are:

  - Displaying the Object Properties by name.
  - Displaying the Object Properties in a Loop.
  - Displaying the Object using Object.values().
  - Displaying the Object using JSON.stringify(). Any JavaScript object can be stringified (converted to a string) with the JavaScript 
    function JSON.stringify().

**JavaScript Accessors (Getters and Setters)**

- Getters and setters allow us to define Object Accessors (Computed Properties). We use accessor because it gives simpler syntax, allows equal syntax for properties and methods, it can secure better data quality and it is useful for doing things behind-the-scenes.

**Object prototype**

- All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
  - Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
  - Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
  - Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
  
- The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

- Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

## Day3

**JavaScript Object**
- Today I have learned about the sub-topics of Js object that is JS OBJ Iterables, sets, and maps.

**JavaScript Object Iterables**
- Iterable objects are objects that can be iterated over with for..of. Technically, iterables must implement the Symbol.iterator method.

**Objects set**
- A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values. Each value can only occur once in a Set and set can hold any value of any data type.
 
- We can create a JavaScript Object Set by:
  - Passing an Array to new Set().
  - Create a new Set and use add() to add values.
  - Create a new Set and use add() to add variables.

**Object maps**
- A Map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype. It remembers the original insertion order of the keys and has a property that represents the size of the map.

- We can create a JavaScript Object Map by:
  - Passing an Array to new Map().
  - Create a Map and use Map.set().
